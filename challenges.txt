CHALLENGE #1: The nearby volcano is going to explode! If it does so, the 
entire world of BioMon will be destroyed. You need to prevent that from 
happening. 

Go find a creature that is suited to hot, dry climates like the 
ones found next to the volcano!
- Embertor: small lizard-like creature that needs warm soil to incubate young
- Aquarion: large amphibian found in dark, wet caves with minimal light
- Mossleaf: deer-like creature found in lush forests with heavy vegetation
- Glacestrike: bear-like mammal whose natural habitat is the polar Arctic

CHALLENGE #2: An earthquake is hitting the forest region! If it can do enough 
damage, most of the trees in the forest will fall down, destroying the ecosystem. 
You need to prevent that from happening. 

Go find a creature that is suited to an ecosystem that is stable (doesn't change easily). 
- Panswipe: large gentle creature that sustains itself only on the magical zudu roots
- Glacestrike: bear-like mammal whose natural habitat is the polar Arctic
- Ratcher: small invasive rodent that has colonized most of the BioMon world
- Sharktooth: large aquatic fish that lives exclusively in warm tropical waters

CHALLENGE #3: The earthquake has triggered a tsunami off the coast! This can destroy
the vital mangrove ecosystems that serve as a home for many organisms. You need to 
prevent that from happening. 

Go find a creature that is suited to equatorial waters, like the ones found on the coast. 
- Glacestrike: bear-like mammal whose natural habitat is the polar Arctic
- Sharktooth: large aquatic fish that lives exclusively in warm waters
- Aquarion: large amphibian found in dark, wet caves with minimal light
- Mossleaf: deer-like creature found in lush forests with heavy vegetation

CHALLENGE #4: The predator-prey dynamics of BioMon have been disrupted, meaning 
the prey populations of BioMon have exploded, damaging the vegetation in the area. 
You need to prevent that from happening. 

Go find a creature that can serve as a predator and restore the prey populations back down.
- Ratcher: small invasive rodent that has colonized most of the BioMon world
- Mossleaf: deer-like creature found in lush forests with heavy vegetation
- Aquarion: large amphibian found in dark, wet caves with minimal light
- Shadowclaw: agile animal that has a long claws and silent movements

CHALLENGE #5: Humans are destroying the rainforest ecosystem in order to make 
space for agriculture. This can be damaging to all of the organisms that need 
the ecosystem as habitat and for resources. You need to prevent that from happening. 

Go find a creature that will be susceptible to habitat destruction in the forests. 
- Mossleaf: deer-like creature found in lush forests with heavy vegetation
- Aquarion: large amphibian found in dark, wet caves with minimal light
- Ratcher: small invasive rodent that has colonized most of the BioMon world
- Glacestrike: bear-like mammal whose natural habitat is the polar Arctic

CHALLENGE #6: The world of BioMon has been contaminated with organisms from the 
nearby mainland's high school. These organisms are r-selected (meaning they reproduce 
fast and greatly), potentially expanding their territory across the entire world. 
You need to prevent that from happening. 

Go find a creature that could be responsible for this new colonization. 
- Ratcher: small invasive rodent that has colonized most of the BioMon world
- Groveback: large apelike creature that is native to forests 
- Glacestrike: bear-like mammal whose natural habitat is the polar Arctic
- Aquarion: large amphibian found in dark, wet caves with minimal light

CHALLENGE #7: The earlier volcano released ash into the atmosphere that blocked 
sunlight from reaching certain areas of the planet. This allowed certain areas, 
like the Arctic, to become even colder, increasing their range. You need 
to prevent that from happening. 

Go find a creature that lives in the polar Arctic and could expand to these new territories.
- Aquarion: large amphibian found in dark, wet caves with minimal light
- Pollenbloom: small bird that is responsible for pollinating most of BioMon
- Glacestrike: bear-like mammal whose natural habitat is the polar Arctic
- Parasight: parasite that attaches to host, weakening it over time

CHALLENGE #8: A herd of large organisms has been infected by a parasite that is 
ravaging their population, especially their young. This can disrupt their predator's 
population through bottom-up control. You need to prevent that from happening.

Go find a creature that resembles that parasite and capture it. 
- Parasight: parasite that attaches to host, weakening it over time
- Pollenbloom: small bird that is responsible for pollinating most of BioMon
- Spinloon: arachnid that lives alone in underground burrows 
- Rockclaw: crab-like organism native to BioMon's coastal habitats

CHALLENGE #9: The caves are being exploited by humans for the minerals, damaging 
the organisms that live there. This can damage the sensitive organisms that aren't
used to human interaction. You need to prevent that from happening.

Go find a creature that is vulnerable to changes in this ecosystem due to their 
specific adaptations. 
- Rockclaw: crab-like organism native to BioMon's coastal habitats
- Aquarion: large amphibian found in dark, wet caves with minimal light
- Pollenbloom: small bird that is responsible for pollinating most of BioMon
- Spinloon: arachnid that lives alone in underground burrows 

CHALLENGE #10: The desert is being converted into agricultural land, fragmenting 
a large part of the ecosystem. This prevents large, migratory animals from completing 
their migration, negatively impacting their population. You need to prevent that 
from happening. 

Go find a creature that needs large, open expanses of land to thrive. 
- Bifon: large boar that eats the roots of a certain zeston tree its entire life
- Spinloon: arachnid that lives alone in underground burrows  
- Thigon: predatory wildcat that stalks its prey for dozens of miles 
- Rockclaw: crab-like organism native to BioMon's coastal habitats
